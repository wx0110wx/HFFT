# High-Frequency Feature Transfer for Multispectral Image Super-Resolution
Implementation of "High-Frequency Feature Transfer for Multispectral Image Super-Resolution" in PyTorch
# Preparation
## Datasets
* We conduct experiments on two remote sensing datasets: GaoFen-1 and GaoFen-2
* GaoFen-1: Contains 4,761 image pairs for training and 680 samples for testing.
* GaoFen-2: Contains 5,322 image pairs for training and 680 samples for testing.
You can download the preprocessed datasets from ï¼Œthen extract them to 'dataset/.'
